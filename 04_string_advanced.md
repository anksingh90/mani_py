# Python Programming Exercises : String - Ex 3 üöÄ

## 1. Energy Calculator ‚ö°
Write a program that calculates equivalent energy using Einstein's famous equation:
> E = mc¬≤

where:
- E = Equivalent energy
- m = Mass of object
- c = Speed of light (‚âà 3√ó10‚Å∏ m/s)

**Input:** Mass of an object  
**Output:** Equivalent energy

## 2. Work Completion Calculator ‚è±Ô∏è
Calculate how many days it will take for three people to complete a work together.

### Formula:
```python
days_together = (x * y * z) / (x*y + y*z + x*z)
```
where:
- x = Days taken by person A alone
- y = Days taken by person B alone
- z = Days taken by person C alone

## 3. Student Grade Calculator üìö
Write a program to calculate grades for 20 students based on their percentage marks.

### Grading Scale:
| Percentage of Marks | Grade |
|:-------------------|:------|
| Above 90%          | A     |
| 80% to 90%        | B     |
| 70% to 80%        | C     |
| 60% to 70%        | D     |
| Below 60%         | E     |

## 4. String Analysis Tool üìù
Create a program that accepts a string and performs the following operations:

1. Count total alphabets
2. Count total vowels
3. Count total spaces

**Example:**
```python
Input: "Hello World!"
Output:
- Alphabets: 10
- Vowels: 3
- Spaces: 1
```

## 5. List Operations üìã
Given the list: `L = [11, 34, 56, 23, 67, 78]`

Perform these operations:
1. Remove 78
2. Insert 89 after 23
3. Clear all contents
4. Sort in ascending order

### Example Operations:
```python
# Initial list
L = [11, 34, 56, 23, 67, 78]

# After removing 78
L = [11, 34, 56, 23, 67]

# After inserting 89
L = [11, 34, 56, 23, 89, 67]

# After sorting
L = [11, 23, 34, 56, 67, 89]

# After clearing
L = []
```

## 6. Write a program to check whether the string is a palindrome or not

## 7. Write a program that reads a line, then counts words and displays how many words are there in the line.

## 8. Write a program that reads a sting and then prints a string that capializes every other letter in the string. eg. school becomes sChOoL.

## 9. Write a program that reads a line then counts how man times a substring 'is/ appears in the line and displays the count.
