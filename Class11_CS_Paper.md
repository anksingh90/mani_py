## 1. Tuple Indexing

Suppose a tuple T1 is declared as:

```python
T = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, '(1, 'a', 3)', 'b')
```

Which of the following statement will print 'a'?

a) `print(T[6][2])`  
b) `print(T[6])`  
c) `print(T[5][1])`  
d) `print(t[5][1])`

## 2. Dictionary Creation

Which of the following statement create a dictionary?

a) `X = { }`  
b) `X = {"Sohan":40, "Mohan":45}`  
c) `X = dict()`  
d) All of the above

## 3. Tuple Concatenation

A tuple is declared as:

```python
T = (10, 5, 5, 10, 15)
```

What will be the output of:

```python
>>> print(T+('a','b'))
```

## 4. Dictionary Keys

Ramesh wants to print all the key values of the dictionary(D) so which of the following command he should use:

1. `print(d.key())`
2. `print(D.keys())`
3. `print(D.keys)`
4. `print(d.key_values())`

## 5. Data Type Identification

Identify the valid declaration of L:

```python
L = ['JAN', '12', 'NEW YEAR', '365']
```

a. dictionary  
b. string  
c. tuple  
d. list

## 6. List Multiplication

Suppose `list=[0,1,2,3]` the statement `print(list*2)` will print:

a) `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3]`  
b) `[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`  
c) `[0, 2, 4, 6]`  
d) `[0, 1, 2, 3]`

## 7. Code Output - String Iteration

Write the output of the following code:

```python
S = "Kendriya"
for i in range(len(S)):
    print(S[i], end='@')
```

---

## 8. Code Output - Even/Odd Check

Write the output of the following code:

```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
for I in L:
    if i%2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")
```

---

## 9. Error Correction

Observe the following Python code very carefully and rewrite it after removing all errors with each correction underlined.

```python
Str = "Jagdalpur"
L = length(Str)
For j in range(L)
    Print(j)
```

---

## 10. Loop Iteration Count

How many times "Hello KV" will be printed after the execution of the following code:

```python
for x in range(0, 20, 2):
    print("Hello KV")
print("Hello KV"*2)
```

## 11. Palindrome Check Program

Write a program to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.

---

## 12. Student Dictionary Management

Write a program to create a dictionary 'Student' to store the data of 10 students, with the key as 'rollno', 'name', 'marks' and do the following:

i. Accept the details of 10 students and display it.

ii. Search & Display the details of a student on the basis of its rollno.

iii. Display the details of topper student.
