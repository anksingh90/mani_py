Write a program to count the number of times a character (ask from user) occurs in the given string.
Write a program which replaces all vowels in the string with '*'.
Write a program to input a string from the user and print it in the reverse order without creating a new string using loop.
Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome or not. (A string is called palindrome if it reads same backwards as forward. For example, Kanak is a palindrome.)
Write a program which takes two parameters : one is a string and other is a character. Create a new string aer deleting all occurrences of the character from the string and return the new string. 

Functions - 

1. Write a user defined function to add 2 numbers and display their sum
#Function to add two numbers
#The requirements are listed below:
	#1. We need to accept 2 numbers from the user.
	#2. Calculate their sum
	#3. Display the sum.

2. Write a program using a user defined function that displays sum of first n natural numbers, where n is passed as an argument.
#Program to find the sum of first n natural numbers
#The requirements are:
	#1. n be passed as an argument
	#2. Calculate sum of first n natural numbers
	#3. Display the sum

3. Write a program using user defined function that accepts an integer and increments the value by 5. Also display the id of argument (before function call), id of parameter before increment and after increment.
#Function to add 5 to a user input number
#The requirements are listed below:
	#1. Display the id()of argument before function call.
	#2. The function should have one parameter to accept the argument
	#3. Display the value and id() of the parameter.
	#4. Add 5 to the parameter
	#5. Display the new value and id()of the parameter to check
		 #whether the parameter is assigned a new memory location or #not.

4. Write a program using a user defined function myMean() to calculate the mean of floating values stored in a list.
#Function to calculate mean
#The requirements are listed below:
	#1. The function should have 1 parameter (list containing floating 
	    #point values)
	#2. To calculate mean by adding all the numbers and dividing by  
	    #total number of elements

5. Write a program using a user defined function calcFact() to calculate and display the factorial of a number num passed as an argument.
#Function to calculate factorial
#The requirements are listed below:
	#1. The function should accept one integer argument from user.
	#2. Calculate factorial. For example:
	#3. Display factorial

6. Write a program using a user defined function that accepts the first name and lastname as arguments, concatenate them to get full name and displays the
output as complete name

7. Write a program that accepts numerator and denominator of a fractional number and calls a user defined function mixedFraction() when the fraction formed is not a proper fraction. The default value of denominator is 1. The function displays a mixed fraction only if the fraction formed by the parameters does not evaluate to a whole number.
#Function to display mixed fraction for an improper fraction
#The requirements are listed below:
	#1. Input numerator and denominator from the user.
	#2. Check if the entered numerator and denominator form a proper
		#fraction.
	#3. If they do not form a proper fraction, then call
		#mixedFraction().
	#4. mixedFraction()display a mixed fraction only when the fraction
		#does not evaluate to a whole number.
