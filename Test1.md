| Below 60%           | E     |

## Exercise 6
Write a program that interactively creates a nested list to store the marks in three subjects for five students. The list will look like:
```python
Marks = [[45,45,40], [35,40,38], [36,30,38], [25,27,20], [10,15,20]]
```
Find the mean of each nested list.
