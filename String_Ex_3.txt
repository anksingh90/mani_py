1. The formula E = mc2 states that the equivalent energy (E) can be calculated as the mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c = about 3Ã—108 m/s) squared.  
Write a program that accepts the mass of an object and determines its equivalent energy.
2. Write a program to calculate in how many days a work will be completed by three persons A, B and C together.  
A, B, C take x days, y days and z days respectively to do the job alone. The formula to calculate the number of days if they work together is xyz/(xy + yz + xz) days where x, y, and z are given as input to the program.
