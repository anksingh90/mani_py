Exercise

1. The formula E = mc2 states that the equivalent energy (E) can be calculated as the mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c = about 3Ã—108 m/s) squared.  
Write a program that accepts the mass of an object and determines its equivalent energy.

2. Write a program to calculate in how many days a work will be completed by three persons A, B and C together.  
A, B, C take x days, y days and z days respectively to do the job alone. The formula to calculate the number of days if they work together is xyz/(xy + yz + xz) 
days where x, y, and z are given as input to the program.

3. Write a program to print the grade of 20 students when grades are allocated as given in the table below. Percentage of the marks obtained by the 20 
students is the input to the program.
Percentage of Marks      Grade
Above 90%                  A
80% to 90%                 B
70% to 80%                 C
60% to 70%                 D
Below 60%                  E

4.  Write a python program to enter a string from the user and perform the following tasks and print the result after all operations:
(i)   Count the number of alphabets present in the string
(ii)  Count the number of vowels present in the string
(iii) Count the number of spaces present in the string

5. L= [11,34,56,23,67,78] is a list in python. Write a python program to :-
(i)     to remove 78 from the list.
(ii)    to insert 89 after 23 in the given list.
(iii)   to clear the contents of the list
(iv)    to sort the contents of the list in ascending order.
