### 1. Generate the following patterns using nested loop:

**a)** 
```
a b c d
e f g
h i
j
```

**c)** 
```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```

### 2. Display the terms of a Fibonacci series.

### 3. Count and display the number of vowels, consonants, uppercase, lowercase characters in string.

### 4. Input a list of numbers and swap elements at the even location with the elements at the odd location.

### 5. Find the error in the following code:

**(a)**
```python
y = x + 5
print (x , y)
```

**(b)**
```python
a = input("Value: ")
b = a/2
print(a, b)
```

**(c)**
```python
print(x = y = 5)
```

### 6. Predict the output of the following:
```python
x, y = 7, 2
x, y, x = x + 1, y+3, x+10
print(x, y)
```

### 7. What will be the output of the following code:
```python
name = 'Hari'
age = 20
print(name,"you are ", age,"now but",end="")
print("You will be ", age+1,"next year")
```

### 8. Write a Program to obtain temperature in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit using formula – (C * 9/5) + 32 = F

### 9. Predict output:
```python
a, b, c = 2, 3, 4
a, b, c = a*a, a*b, a*c
print(a, b, c)
```

### 10. What will be the output of the following?

**(a)** `bool(0)`  
**(b)** `bool("0")`  
**(c)** `bool(int("0"))`

### 11. What will be the output of the following?

**(a)** `87//5`  
**(b)** `(87//5.0) == (87//5)`  
**(c)** `87//5.0`  
**(d)** `17 % 5.0`
