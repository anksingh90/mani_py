# String and Function Programming Exercises : String - Ex 1 üöÄ

## Part A: String Manipulation Exercises

### 1. Character Counter
Write a program to count the number of times a character (ask from user) occurs in the given string.

### 2. Vowel Replacer
Write a program which replaces all vowels in the string with '*'.
```python
# Example:
Input: "Hello World"
Output: "H*ll* W*rld"
```

### 3. String Reversal
Write a program to input a string from the user and print it in the reverse order without creating a new string using loop.
```python
# Example:
Input: "Python"
Output: "nohtyP"
```

### 4. Palindrome Checker ‚≠ê
Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome or not.
> Note: A string is called palindrome if it reads same backwards as forward.
```python
# Example:
Input: "Kanak"
Output: "Kanak is a palindrome"
```

### 5. Character Deletion
Write a program which takes two parameters:
- A string
- A character
Create a new string after deleting all occurrences of the character from the string and return the new string.

## Part B: Function Programming Exercises üîß

### 6. Simple Addition Function
Write a user defined function to add 2 numbers and display their sum.

**Requirements:**
1. Accept 2 numbers from the user
2. Calculate their sum
3. Display the sum

### 7. Natural Numbers Sum
Write a program using a user defined function that displays sum of first n natural numbers.
> Note: n is passed as an argument

### 8. Value Incrementer with Memory Address
Write a program using user defined function that:
1. Accepts an integer
2. Increments the value by 5
3. Displays:
   - ID of argument (before function call)
   - ID of parameter before increment
   - ID of parameter after increment

### 9. Mean Calculator üìä
Write a program using a user defined function `myMean()` to calculate the mean of floating values stored in a list.

### 10. Factorial Calculator
Write a program using a user defined function `calcFact()` to calculate and display the factorial of a number.
```python
# Example:
Input: 5
Output: 120  # (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
```

### 11. Name Concatenator
Write a program using a user defined function that:
- Accepts first name and lastname as arguments
- Concatenates them to get full name
- Displays the complete name

### 12. Mixed Fraction Calculator
Write a program that handles fractional numbers with following specifications:
- Accepts numerator and denominator
- Calls `mixedFraction()` for improper fractions
- Default denominator value is 1
- Displays mixed fraction only for non-whole number results

### 13. Student Marks Manager üìö
Create a program that:
1. Gets number of students in class
2. Stores marks in a list
3. Displays all marks
4. Allows deletion of specific student's marks
5. Shows updated marks list

## Tips for Solutions üí°
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add proper input validation
- Include error handling where necessary
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Test with different input cases

## Example Output Format üìù
```python
Enter number: 5
Result: Processing...
Final Output: Completed!
```
