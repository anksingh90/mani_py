Question 1: Treasure Hunt Game
Design a Python program to create a Treasure Hunt game using a dictionary.

Game Requirements:
- Create a dictionary with 5 locations numbered from 1 to 5.
- Initially, store the value ***"Empty"*** for all locations.
- Randomly select one location to hide the treasure and update its value to ***"Treasure"***.
- Allow the player 3 attempts to guess the treasure location.

After each guess:
- If the guess is correct, display a success message and end the game.
- If incorrect, display an appropriate message and reduce the remaining attempts.
- If the player fails to find the treasure after all attempts, display the correct treasure location.
