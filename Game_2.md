# 1. Programming Project: Casino Slot Machine (User vs System) #

## Objective ##
Design and implement a Casino Slot Machine game in Python where a user plays against the system. The game must use only basic Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, lists, dictionaries, and random number generation.

---

## *Game Rules and Requirements ##
### 1. Symbols and Slots ###
 * The slot machine uses 7 symbols, represented using numbers and stored in a dictionary:

```python
1 → Cherry  
2 → Lemon  
3 → Orange  
4 → Star  
5 → Diamond  
6 → Seven  
7 → Jackpot
```
 * Each spin generates three random symbols using only one of the following functions:
    - `random()`
    - `randint()`
    - `randrange()`
